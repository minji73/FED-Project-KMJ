    explain:
      "The work of Jean-Paul Agosti begins with taking photographs, and then a portion of those photographs is enlarged and replaced with painting. The subjects of the photographs he captures are very consistent, including gardens, forests, and trees reflected in water. As the photograph is transformed into a painting, the colors and forms undergo changes according to the artist's subjective interpretation, forming a new world. (Excerpt from the artist introduction in the Lee Eungno Museum, Lee Yung-se & Jean-Paul Agosti joint exhibition)",

    edition: "Limited edition 45",
    explain: "Andy Limenter, an artist who gained recognition in Korea through solo exhibitions and brand collaborations, is showcasing new paintings and limited editions for this exhibition. While Andy's early works had a strong illustrative feel with clean lines, shapes, and coloring, his more recent works have embraced a painterly approach, with the mysterious expressions of the characters now becoming a distinctive feature of his style. The use of bright colors and contrasting mysterious moods has led to praise, making Andy's works even more intriguing.",
